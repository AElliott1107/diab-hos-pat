### Hospital Patient and Blood Glucose Information

This application gives individuals with diabetes information on the effect of time of day, and meal ingestion on blood glucose measurements for at-home diabetes management.  It also gives an overview of patients admitted to the hospital and looks at the age, distribution and typical days spent in the hospital for the admitted patient.  Finally, this application will predict the time a patient could spend in the hospital based on the number of medications that patient is on.  An overview of each section can be found below.

#### Blood Glucose Tab

This tab visualizes the blood glucose measurements from 70 individuals, from 1988 through 1991.  Filters for this visualization includes the date range as well as a category selection that allows the user to observe measurements for time of day (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) as well as pre and post meal.

#### Hospital Tab

This tab visualizes the distribution of age, gender and time spent in the hospital for patients from 130 US hospitals from 1999 - 2008.  Below these distributions, the user can enter the number of medications and observe the predicted time in hospital in the corresponding scatter plot.  Finally, the decision tree used in the prediction model is displayed.
